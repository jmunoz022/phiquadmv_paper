phiquadmv paper scripts
========================

Matlab scripts to reproduce the results in [1].

**Note:** this repo contains the scripts the way they were used to produce the results in [1].
While the scripts in this repo are self-sufficient, the software developed in [1] is mantained in a separate repo, see [2].

Dependencies
------------

* Matlab >= r2021b
* Chebfun (available for free at https://www.chebfun.org/)

Installation
-------------

Just make sure that chebfun is in the Matlab path.
